# Stock-Price-Prediction-Dashboard

This was a personal project that helped me improve my skills with these valuable tools: 

• Developed a predictive web application using Flask to forecast stock prices based on historical data, utilizing Linear Regression to model the
relationship between stock prices and technical indicators

• Implemented real-time data ingestion from the yFinance API, processing and engineering features like 5-day moving averages using Pandas to
enhance model accuracy

• Deployed the app on a local server and utilized ngrok for secure tunnelling, enabling real-time access to the model via a publicly accessible URL,
improving user interaction and accessibility

• Optimized model performance through feature selection and training, achieving predictive accuracy while integrating data visualization to display
predictions and trends interactively
